powder deposition direction directly affects the superficial finishing of the material as dross or deposits from the process can be present: the angle of deposition directly influences the roughness and the accuracy of the produced parts. Staircase effects is related to the discretization of the different layers: the bigger the layers the less smooth the surface will be. In general, it can be observed that the more the build direction $\alpha$ of a generic piece shifts from perpendicular ( $\alpha$ = 0°), to parallel, ( $\alpha$ = 90°), the roughness increases and accuracy lowers;
